excerpt: "A review of Eric Ries's 'The Lean Startup': How continuous innovation creates radically successful businesses."
---

For most of May and part of June 2017, I have been reading **“The Lean Startup: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses”** by Eric Ries.

Here is someone I can look up to; he is a founder of several startups in Silicon Valley and works closely with many others. I also share a common background with him: undergraduate studies in computer engineering.

It is certainly one of the best business books I have read to date.

### Startup vs. Business

For starters, a **startup** and a **business** are not exactly the same thing. A startup, unlike a normal business, is set up to solve a need that is still unmet, and its chances of success are often minimal (high uncertainty). Consider Dropbox, which enabled us to store our files online, or WhatsApp, which revolutionised communication.

A traditional business, however, is often a replica of another money-making entity elsewhere. Uganda is lauded as the most entrepreneurial country in the world, but in the world of scalable technology startups, we still have a long way to go.

### Continuous Learning

The book emphasises that the great companies of the 21st century will be those that **continuously learn** from the ground up and keep evolving to create value for their customers.

In this day and age, continuous learning—building, measuring, learning—is the way to go. I hope you can grab yourself a copy too.
