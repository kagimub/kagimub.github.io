I have never read a book as inspiring and motivational as **THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE®** by Dr. Stephen R. Covey. In the book, he teaches that "One cannot have the fruits without the roots."

If you really want to have impact, there is no shortcut. Rather there are 7 golden principles which have been proven to produce results over time. 

### The 7 Habits

1.  **Be proactive**. Do not wait for life to happen to you. Take the initiative. You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control how you react.
2.  **Begin with the end in mind**. Have a clear picture of the final result you want to see.
3.  **Put first things first**. Focus energy on things that matter most.
4.  **Think Win-Win**. Seek mutual benefit in all human interactions.
5.  **Seek first to understand, then to be understood**. Listen with empathy before prescribing a solution.
6.  **Synergize**. "Two heads are better than one." Collaborative teamwork leads to better results.
7.  **Sharpen the saw**. Continuously improve yourself—physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually.

I highly recommend you get yourself a copy. Thank you Dr. Stephen R. Covey. Your legacy lives on.
