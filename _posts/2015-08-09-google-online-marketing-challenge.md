**Mbarara University of Science and Technology** should be glad. Uganda must celebrate. A team of six students from the University recently emerged as **AdWords Business Semi-Finalists** in the **Google Online Marketing Challenge 2015**.

### The Challenge
The Google Online Marketing Challenge is an annual global advertising competition. A University team of 3 to 6 students, guided by a lecturer, sets out to market a local business online using **Google AdWords** over a period of 21 days with a budget of $250 provided by Google.

Our team advertised a local business, *Masanyu*, which sells computer devices.

### The Results
The competition brought together **1,761 teams** from four regions:
*   584 from the Americas
*   199 from Asia & Pacific
*   811 from Europe
*   106 from Middle East & Africa

Of these, only 5 teams represented Uganda—2 being from Mbarara University.

Our team was ranked as an **AdWords Business Semi-Finalist**, which means we "demonstrated very good AdWords proficiency and understanding of online advertising" and were among the **Top 15 teams in Middle East & Africa** (and Top 60 globally).

### The Team
*   **Noah Aboda** (Team Captain)
*   **Mirembe Vaolah**
*   **Nestor Atukwatse**
*   **Byamukama Boniface**
*   **Katusiime Patricia**
*   **Kagimu Brian Vicent**

*Faculty Mentor*: Dr. Annabella Habinka Ejiri (Director, Institute of Computer Science).

I am so glad to have been part of this amazing team. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn digital marketing skills together.
