According to the World Health Organisation, every year the lives of more than **1.25 million people** are cut short as a result of road traffic crashes. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability.

This is not helped by the trend that most road accidents in Uganda occur during the festive season due to reckless driving.

Therefore on 13th December 2017, in the Rotary spirit of *Service Above Self*, the **Rotary Club of Nsangi** in collaboration with the **Uganda Police**, **Ministry of Works and Transport**, community leaders, and the Rotaract Club of Nsangi carried out their annual **Road Safety Awareness Campaign** along the Kampala-Masaka road.

We handed out flyers with road safety messages to road users (pedestrians, drivers, etc.), gave safety jackets to select *boda boda* riders, and painted a zebra crossing in Nsangi town.

We hope that this will help raise more awareness and save lives. Remember, speed kills—and don’t drink and drive.
