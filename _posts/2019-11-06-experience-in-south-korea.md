Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! 안녕하세요 (Annyeong Haseyo). Happy new month of November.

I have now been in South Korea for a little over 11 weeks. Today I am going to write about 3 things: **Safety and Transport**, the **2019 Super Blue Marathon**, and my first birthday in Korea.

### Safety and Transport

South Korea, like other developed countries, has a well-organized transport network. Public transport is widely used—buses and the subway are everywhere. Because the majority of the population have smartphones, there are plenty of location-based applications such as **Kakao Map**, **Naver Map**, and **Google Maps** that ease navigation.

All you have to do is choose your destination. It will detect your current location and give you choices about which buses or trains can take you there, the time taken, and the fee. You will also need a rechargeable transport card (T-money) to check-in and out.

Secondly, **safety on the roads is very high**. One can move freely almost at any time of the day with little fear of harm or danger.

### 2019 Super Blue Marathon

And now for the fun part: athletics. This month was one of celebration as **Eliud Kipchoge**, the Kenyan long-distance runner, broke the two-hour mark in the INEOS 1:59 Challenge. Well done to everyone that made it happen.

I too took part in a marathon here in Korea: the **2019 Super Blue Marathon** on October 5. The Super Blue Campaign aims to improve awareness of the disabled through running together—disabled and non-disabled side by side. I got a chance to meet friends and new people while keeping healthy.

### A New Beginning (My Birthday)

October is also a special month for me; one of love, birth, and new beginnings. I thank God I made 28 years of age. It started as a normal day, but my classmates and class coordinator ensured that it ended on a high note; a birthday surprise, cake, and merry-making. Thank you guys and thank you to everyone who made sure the day was special to me through your wishes.

As I conclude, allow me to congratulate all my friends at **Mbarara University of Science and Technology** who also graduated this October. Until next time, bye.
