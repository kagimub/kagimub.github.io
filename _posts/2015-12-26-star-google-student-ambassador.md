To do something that changes a life is something I hope to do each and every day. I am so grateful that I was the **Google Student Ambassador (GSA)** to such an awesome university like **Mbarara University of Science and Technology**.

Recently, I received the **Star Google Student Ambassador Award** from Google on behalf of the super awesome "Googley" students at the University. This was in recognition of the remarkable work we did together:
*   The Android Students' Club
*   The Google AdClass members
*   The Google Online Marketing Challenge teams
*   Google Summer of Code 2015 participants

I would like to thank **Mr. Chimdindu Aneke**, **Ms. Jeminatu Alabi-Isama**, and the entire GSA Programme team. Also, special thanks to the staff at the Institute of Computer Science, my mother Mrs. Gertrude Kalule, and the entire GSA community in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Most importantly, thank you God for this Christmas gift. As always, don't forget to...
**Do Cool Things That Matter.**
